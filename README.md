This repository contains files related to the "Science of the Slam" workshop for the Triple Helix project at RPI.
Triple Helix is an NSF-funded interdisciplinary science project that allows collaboration between graduate students and academics and local students and/or community members
in addressing local issues related to health, environment, poverty, crime, information access, and more.

To fully utilize this repo you will also need an Arduino and to build the photogate equipment described on the CDST website (https://community.csdt.rpi.edu/cms/application-contexts/diy-sports-science-lab/diyphotogate/)

==TO USE THE PROGRAM==

1.) Use the Arduino IDE to load the analogread.ino program in this repo onto your Arduino.

2.) Set up the DIY Arduino photogate hardware described above.

3.) Connect the Arduino to your computer with a USB port.

4.) On the same computer, start up the Python program display.py, also from this repo.

5.) Begin the demonstration!
